PROJECT 3 Submission - Sandy Gross


First: Game info

1: Darth will welcome you to the game

2. For each "game" you get 3 lives 
	represented by the three frogs at the top
	when you have a collision, a frog is removed and you'll hear a tone
	(except on the last one when the frogger music plays)
3. After 3 lives - the frogger music plays and the game is reset

4. Your high score is maintained so you can keep trying to beat your best score

...Darth will be there to ensure the force is with you, which we all know is critical to life itself.

5. Your score increases by 50 each time you reach the water and 
	you lose a life each time you colide with a bug/enemy

Where did I get info -
I found images on the web.
I learned about adding sound by googling and looking at lots of gaming code until if found the one easy one.
	man, there are some complicated ones...but it probably helps 
	because they involve preloading like we did with the images
I did look at what some other students did in Git and found a lot of different
	complicated styles and some really expert styles.  I'm still learning so I
	realize my code is a mix if js and object oriented as I'm not always confident
	in what i'm doing.

My biggets frustration - without using any f words - the fact that there is s
no easy way or hard way or stupid way to really implement a "delay"  function in
javascript.  What's with that?  I want my music to play and then start another game but that's 
not what happen's..and i tried all those techniques they give you when you google around.  So, the game
isn't as perfect as i'd like - it doesnt look to the user like it resets as it should but that's becuase it
reset as soon as the music started playing and the other game was over.  I spent a lot of time on that
and just gave up on stupid work arounds and let JavaScript have its way.

The Style Guide is a little confusing for me.  Hopefully, if you ding me on that,you'll explain what you didnt like.

There just isnt enough time to practice between class and projects to understand concepts and understnad the
style guide and all that. 

May the force be with me.
